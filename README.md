# Bloc Jams

Bloc Jams is the first web app I built during my web development course through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloc.io/">Bloc</a>. It's a demo of a music player app that works with a user's personal library. This app was first written in JavaScript, then refactored into jQuery, and then completely refactored into AngularJS for learning purposes.

This repo is the source code for the project exploring AngularJS.
